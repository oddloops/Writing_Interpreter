*Lexer
** Lexcial Analysis
Also known as "lexing", it is the transformation from source code to tokens.

*** _To run_
1. Navigate the the desired directory ("monkey" in this instance).
#+begin_src shell
go init mod monkey
#+end_src
2. From the "monkey" directory, run test using the following command:
#+begin_src shell
go test .\lexer\
#+end_src
*TODO Expand support*
[] Support Unicode and UTF-8. Changes to l.ch from byte or rune and how characters are read
[] Support floats, numbers in hex notation, octal notation, etc.
[] Create a method, makeTwoCharToken, to abstract support for more two (or more) character tokens
