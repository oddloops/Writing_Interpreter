*Lexer
** Lexcial Analysis
Also known as "lexing", it is the transformation from source code to tokens.

A *lexer* (also known as a /tokenizer/ or /scanner/) performs this transformation.

*Tokens* are small, easily categorizable unit or data stream.

*** _To run_
Navigate the the desired directory ("monkey" in this instance).
#+begin_src shell
go init mod monkey
#+end_src
From the "monkey" directory, run test using the following command:
#+begin_src shell
go test .\lexer\
#+end_src
To run the Go Lang main file
From the "monkey" directory, run test using the following command:
#+begin_src shell
go run main.go
#+end_src

*** TODO Expand support
- [ ] Support Unicode and UTF-8. Changes to l.ch from byte or rune and how characters are read
- [ ] Support floats, numbers in hex notation, octal notation, etc.
- [ ] Create a method, makeTwoCharToken, to abstract support for more two (or more) character tokens
